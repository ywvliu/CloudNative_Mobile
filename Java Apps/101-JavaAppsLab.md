Because this is the first Lab 1xx - Java App, we need to login to DevCS and therefore:  
Select `Traditional Cloud Account`, then select    
    `US Commercial 2 (us2)`   
or    
    `EMEA Commercial 2 (em2)`    
according to the datacenter of your environment listed in access document.  Click **My Services** button.
